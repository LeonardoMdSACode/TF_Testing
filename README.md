# Tensorflow

Testing some ML and NN algorithms with Tensorflow and Keras on PyCharm

1. Simple regression (Celsius to Fahrenheit converter)
2. Simple Image Classification
3. CNN
4. CNN with colors and resize
5. CNN with data augmentation (dropout and image augmentation)
6. CNN with transfer learning
7. Time Series bases - Common Patterns=(Trend, Seasonality and noise),  naive forecasting, moving average, time windows.
8. Time Series - RNN, stateless RNN, stateful RNN, LSTM, 1D and CNN
9. NLP - word embedding, embedding sentiment, subwords, LSTM sentiment, CNN, GRU.
10. NLP - word generation with LSTM
